rl-project-genesis
==================

Project Genesis is a Roguelike being developed in C.

There are undoubtedly many problems in terms of both
form and functionality as the lead developer is not
a seasoned programmer. This is a learning project!

This roguelike is not feature complete in any sense and
should not be even considered a stable build. Do not
build or execute this code on any machine that is doing
actual work of any kind.

Genesis is being written and compiled on a Raspberry Pi.
Cross-platform capabilities are currently untested and
consequently unknown. It may compile on x86/x64, it may
not. Any feedback on the matter would be welcomed.

Current Requrements:
Linux 3.6.11+ [armv61]
NCurses development libraries
80x24 Terminal Window
