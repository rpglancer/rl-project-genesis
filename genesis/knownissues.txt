HIGH PRIORITY
1: Occasional failure of the BSP to come up with a usable map

2: Occasional floating point error [div0]- possibly related to 1.


MODERATE:
1:The MSGQUEUE in a first in last out system, so as it stands now
player actions are evauluated last.


MINOR:
1: The frame [border] of the map is never evaluated for wall fill.
